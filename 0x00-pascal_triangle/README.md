# Project: 0x00. Pascal's Triangle
This project is about creating a function that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of `n` given rows.
it is a mathematical concept that is represented by a triangle of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
it does require you to have a good understanding of:
- List comprehension and nested lists
- Iteration and loops
- conditional statements
- Exception handling
- indexing and slicing
- memory management
- efficiency and optimization
